        Setting goals is difficult. Remembering and keeping to them makes it harder. Working with a mentor is very helpful, but only when the mentor is with you. <br /> <br />
        <tab1>We are developing a solution that can be really helpful. We aim to build an easy-to-use App. Set your goal, then record your goal in a place you can access easily.
        The best part, you can do this with your mentor, even when he’s not with you. This app will allow you an easy and simple ability to be in contact with your mentor.
        You can send messages, talk face-to-face or even share drawn ideas. Giving encouragement and recording how much you have accomplished will make it much easier to reach your goal!<br /> <br />
