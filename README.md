Setting goals is difficult. Remembering and keeping to them makes it harder. Working with a mentor is very helpful, but only when the 
mentor is with you.

We are developing a solution that can be really helpful. We aim to build an easy-to-use App. Set your goal, then record your goal in a 
place you can access easily. The best part, you can do this with your mentor, even when heâ€™s not with you. This app will allow you an 
easy and simple ability to be in contact with your mentor. You can send messages, talk face-to-face or even share drawn ideas. Giving 
encouragement and recording how much you have accomplished will make it much easier to reach your goal!

To reach a goal, it is easier to have a relaxed mentality. If you find a similar type of helpmate that is expensive, complicated and 
stressful to use, it may be easier to reach your goal without it. We aim for simplicity, to be easy to use, and share a mutual goal:

OUR GOAL IS TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL!
